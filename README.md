## Welcomme to Petful

Adopt pets that really need your love! Petful is a pet adoption application that works based on a first-in, first-out approach. Pets are allowed to be adopted in the order they arrive in the shelter, and potential adopters are served in the order they sign up for adoption. In this way, Petful makes a difficult descision easy for all pet lovers. How convenient!

Get started by registering as a new user and adding yourself to the queue. You will then be taken to the adoption page, where you can see pets currently eligible for adoption, pets that are soon to be eligible, and your position in the queue of adopters. 

## Technologies Used 

The Petful Client was created using ReactJS and CSS.

## Thanks

The developers would like to thank the entire Thinkful team for their guidance throughout the course of this project. We would also like to thank you for your interest in using our work. We hope that you will enjoy using this API as much as we have enjoyed building it.

The following information pertains to getting started with your React app.


This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
